Quick Build Notes
Although you don't need a web10g kernel to build, if you wish to run the server you will.

I've tested with linux 3.5.1 kernel patched with web10g (web10.org - 	Web10G-0.4-3.5-patch). I had to modify the patch - Swap ktime_to_ns(...) with ktime_to_us(...).

You need to make and install the Web10G-userland library I used Web10G-userland-2.0.4.

NOTE: The older estats-userlands are not supported so the 3.2 kernel and earlier will not work.

Configure and build ndt as normal. Web10G libs should be detected and hence the web10gsrv built. Web100 is still fully supported and if Web100 libs are found web100srv will be built.

Known issues

Web10G related
* Logging functionality not yet implemented some related functions are missing.
* Web10g kernel patch not quite right - need to modify ktime_to_ns to ktime_to_us.
* Server and Client(C and Java Applet) have been ported, other tools have not. Depending on their function they may not work.

Other
* Running the server without a DNS server can cause tests to timeout and fail. Add the NI_NUMERICHOST flag into the getnameinfo call within _I2AddrSetNodePort() in the I2Util library to fix.
* MSS incorrectly detecting modification when testing via IPv6??
